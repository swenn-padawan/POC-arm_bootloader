# POC-arm_bootloader
Minimal AArch32 bootloader for STM32-based embedded systems. This PoC demonstrates low-level bare-metal initialization on a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M microcontroller. It sets up the stack, initializes hardware peripherals, and executes a basic payload, all without an operating system.
