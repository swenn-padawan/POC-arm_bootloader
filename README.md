# POC-arm_bootloader

Minimal AArch32 bootloader for STM32-based embedded systems.  
This Proof of Concept demonstrates low-level bare-metal initialization on a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M microcontroller.  
It sets up the stack, configures hardware peripherals, and executes a basic payload ‚Äî all without an operating system.

## Setup

Before writing a single line of code, we need to prepare our development environment.

We'll use **QEMU** to emulate the STM32 board and test our bootloader without flashing a physical device ‚Äî ideal for rapid iteration and debugging.

Additionally, I plan to use **Nix flakes** (with help from ChatGPT) to ensure a reproducible setup across all operating systems and machines, with the necessary toolchains and dependencies installed automatically.

Since most machines aren't ARM-based, we'll need a cross-compiler to run our ARM code on an x86 system. I won't go into the theory behind it...

### üß∞ Why Nix?

Setting up a cross-compilation environment for bare-metal ARM can be a pain ‚Äî especially when you're working on different machines or in a school environment with missing packages.
Different platforms, toolchain versions, and missing dependencies all add unnecessary friction to the process.

Nix solves that by creating a reproducible, declarative environment.
It ensures that anyone can build and test this bootloader on any machine (Linux, macOS, etc.) with exactly the same tools and versions.

#### üì¶ What it does

The Nix setup in this repo:

- Installs an ARM bare-metal cross-compiler (like arm-none-eabi-gcc)
- Installs QEMU to run the bootloader without real hardware
- Installs build tools like make, nasm, or others if needed
- Works with Nix Flakes for better reproducibility

#### üöÄUsage
To launch our setup you just have to copy my flake.nix and run this command:
```bash
nix develop
```

##### Help to install nix
Run this command to install nix
```bash
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install)
```
Once installed, you can restart your session or run:
```bash
. /etc/profile.d/nix.sh
```
When you are going to run `nix develop`, you can encounter an error that tells to enable experimental-features.
To prevent this, you can run:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/nix
echo "experimental-features = nix-command flakes" > ~/.config/nix/nix.conf
```
It will had the nix-command and flakes features by default.

GG! Now you have a functionnal shell with all the packages required !

### üõ†Ô∏è Makefile

A Makefile automates the compilation steps so you don‚Äôt have to write long commands every time.
I won‚Äôt go into the details of how Makefiles work, but if you‚Äôre serious about low-level development, you should definitely learn it.

I‚Äôve written this one with comments to help you understand what's going on.
You can either study and reproduce it, or just use it as-is and follow along with this PoC.

To build and run the bootloader, simply run:
```bash
make && make run
```

This will:
- assemble the code
- link it using the linker script
- generate a .bin file
- and launch it in QEMU using the make run command

That's all you need to get your bootloader up and running in an emulator.
